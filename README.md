Medisch leerfons (medical education fund) was a project that me and two of my friends worked on during the Digital proof hackathon 2023.
This website was a solution for practise managers of general practice centers. The problem was that the managers didnt have enough time to apply
for subsidy for the education of their employees. so thats why we created a prototype of a simple to navigate site where they can wath instruction
video's, read FAQ's, and call for help with experts ( the number provided in the code does'nt connect you with an expert, it connects you with a dutch theme
park called efteling ). we ended up winning the audience vote for our project and got second in the jury's vote.
